At **Hive DB Inc**., our work centers on engineering and supporting sophisticated data systems and related technologies. The success of this endeavor is critically linked to the health, professionalism, and productivity of the community surrounding it.

This **Code of Conduct** serves as the foundational agreement for our community, defining the standards of behavior that enable us to achieve our technical goals. We are committed to fostering an environment of rigorous innovation and focused collaboration. 

This document is not merely a checklist; it is the framework that protects our shared workspace, ensuring that discussions remain centered on technical merit, constructive feedback, and the collective advancement of the project. 

We expect all participants—from the core team to first-time contributors—to uphold these standards in all project-related interactions, thereby contributing to a professional and effective ecosystem where great software can be built.

## 1. Applicability and Scope
This **Code of Conduct** is a **foundational policy** for all professional engagement **with Hive DB Inc**. projects and communities.

### 1.1. Who This Policy Applies To
This policy applies to all individuals (hereafter "**Participants**") who interact with the **Hive DB Inc**. community or projects. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Hive DB Inc. employees, contractors, and designated representatives.

- External contributors, maintainers, and committers.

- Users providing feedback, filing issues, or asking questions.

- Sponsors, partners, and vendors.

- Participants in official or sponsored events.

- Any individual present in a project-managed space.

Participation in any of these capacities, whether voluntary or as part of an engagement with **Hive DB Inc**., constitutes an agreement to abide by this **Code of Conduct**.

### 1.2. Where This Policy Applies
This **Code of Conduct** applies to all official project spaces and communication channels managed or sponsored by **Hive DB Inc**., whether they are online or offline. These spaces include, but are not limited to:

- **Code Repositories:** All codebases, issue trackers, pull requests, and discussions on platforms such as GitHub.

- **Communication Channels:** Official community forums, chat servers (e.g., Slack, Discord), and mailing lists.

- **Events:** All company-sponsored or community-organized events, including conferences, workshops, meetups, and webinars.

- **Official Documentation:** All wikis, documentation pages, and comment sections.

- **Direct Communication:** Project-related one-on-one communications (e.g., emails, direct messages) initiated within the context of the community.


This list is not exhaustive. This policy may be applied to any situation or platform where a **Participant's** conduct is reasonably judged to be disruptive to the community's health, professionalism, or the project's goals. Actions taken outside of these spaces that are intended to or have the effect of harassing a **Participant** or disrupting the project may also be subject to review and enforcement.

<hr>

## 2. Standards for Professional Conduct
To create and maintain an environment that aligns with our philosophy, **Hive DB Inc**. expects all **Participants** to adhere to the following standards. These standards represent our baseline expectations for a healthy, productive, and professional community.

- **Treat all Participants with Respect.** We require all interactions to be grounded in professional courtesy. Treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their background, experience level, technical opinions, or personal beliefs.

- **Maintain a Focus on the Project.** All communication should be aimed at advancing the project's technical and strategic goals. Keep discussions and debates focused on the merits of the code, architecture, and proposals.

- **Engage Constructively.** Provide and receive feedback constructively. When disagreeing, critique ideas, code, and proposals—not individuals. Engineering requires rigorous debate; conduct that debate with professionalism.

- **Assume Good Faith.** Assume other Participants are operating with good intentions. Seek clarification before assuming negative intent. Be mindful of how your own tone and wording may be perceived in a global, text-based medium.

- **Be Collaborative and Precise.** Communicate with clarity and precision. Good collaboration relies on clear communication, a willingness to explain one's reasoning, and an openness to being persuaded.

- **Take Responsibility.** Be accountable for your actions and mistakes. If you err, take ownership, correct it, and learn from the experience. Support other Participants who are doing the same.

<hr>

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior
To ensure our standards are upheld, the following behaviors are explicitly prohibited within all spaces governed by this **Code of Conduct**. Any Participant who engages in this conduct will be subject to enforcement.

- **Harassment and Discrimination** This includes, but is not limited to: offensive comments related to any personal characteristic or belief; unwelcome sexual attention or advances; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or other events; and any conduct that creates an intimidating or hostile environment.

- **Personal Attacks and Insults** This includes: insulting, demeaning, or belittling comments, whether public or private; ad hominem attacks (*attacking the person instead of the idea*); and any language intended to malign or humiliate another Participant.

- **Trolling, Baiting, and Bad Faith Engagement** This includes: any behavior intended to provoke, bait, or antagonize others; deliberate misrepresentation of facts; and any form of engagement not made in good faith to advance the project's goals.

- **Disruptive and Off-Topic Conduct** This includes:
Derailing: Steering a technical or project-focused discussion significantly off-topic to pursue an unrelated agenda or complaint.

  - **Ideological or Personal Debates:** Initiating or sustaining discussions on sensitive social, political, or personal topics that are not relevant to the project's technical or logistical needs.

  - **Spamming:** Posting irrelevant, repetitive, or unsolicited content.

  - **Unwelcome Disclosures:** Discussing or questioning other **Participants** about their personal lives, beliefs, or preferences in a manner not relevant to the project task at hand.

- **Publishing Private Information ("Doxxing")** Publishing or threatening to publish another **Participant's** private information—such as a physical address, phone number, or private correspondence—without their explicit permission.

- **Incitement and Retaliation** Encouraging or advocating for any of the above behaviors. This also includes any form of retaliation against a **Participant** who files a report in good faith or assists in an investigation.

- **Other Unprofessional Conduct** Any other conduct that is not explicitly listed but is reasonably judged to be disruptive, unprofessional, or in violation of the spirit of this policy.

Upholding our standards is a shared responsibility. All **Participants** are expected to report violations, and **Hive DB Inc**. pledges to investigate and enforce this policy fairly and consistently.

### 4.1. Reporting Violations

1. **Confirm Receipt:** Acknowledge receipt of the report to the reporter (*unless the report is anonymous*).

2. **Conduct Review:** Review the provided evidence and determine if the behavior constitutes a violation.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** The review will be conducted with impartiality. In cases that are not clear-cut, the committee may need to contact the accused party for their account of the event.

5. **Determine Action:** Based on the findings, the committee will determine an appropriate and proportional response.

- **A Public Warning:** A public acknowledgment of the violation (*without naming the reporter*) and a warning to the individual.

### 4.4. Appeals
Decisions resulting in a temporary or permanent ban may be appealed one time.

The **Conduct Committee** will review the appeal and deliver a final, binding decision.
